# Changed in 1.08 to use correct address for sendmail.
# Changed in 1.09 to close the REP file before calling it up in the editor.
#                 Also removed some old comments duplicated elsewhere.
# Changed in 1.10 to run under VMS without Mail::Send; also fixed
#                 temp filename generation.
# Changed in 1.11 to clean up some text and removed Mail::Send deactivator.
# Changed in 1.12 to check for editor errors, make save/send distinction
#                 clearer and add $ENV{REPLYTO}.
# Changed in 1.13 to hopefully make it more difficult to accidentally
#                 send mail
# Changed in 1.14 to make the prompts a little more clear on providing
#                 helpful information. Also let file read fail gracefully.

# TODO: Allow the user to re-name the file on mail failure, and

the report concise but descriptive. Include any

that does not work as you think it should, please
try to include example of both the actual

Some information about your local
perl configuration will automatically be included

unusual version of perl, please try and confirm
exactly which versions are relevant.

the report. If "$ed" is the editor you want

sub Help {
	print <<EOF; 

A program to help generate bug reports about perl5, and mail them. 
It is designed to be used interactively. Normally no arguments will
be needed.
	
Usage:
$0  [-v] [-a address] [-s subject] [-b body | -f file ]
    [-r returnaddress] [-e editor] [-c adminaddress | -C] [-S] [-t]
    
Simplest usage:  run "$0", and follow the prompts.

Options:

  -v    Include Verbose configuration data in the report
  -f    File containing the body of the report. Use this to 
        quickly send a prepared message.
  -S    Send without asking for confirmation.
  -a    Address to send the report to. Defaults to `$address'.
  -c    Address to send copy of report to. Defaults to `$cc'.
  -C    Don't send copy to administrator.
  -s    Subject to include with the message. You will be prompted 
        if you don't supply one on the command line.
  -b    Body of the report. If not included on the command line, or
        in a file with -f, you will get a chance to edit the message.
  -r    Your return address. The program will ask you to confirm
        this if you don't give it here.
  -e    Editor to use. 
  -t    Test mode. The target address defaults to `$testaddress'.
  -d	Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe output.) 
        This prints out your configuration data, without mailing
        anything. You can use this with -v to get more complete data.
